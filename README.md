# Visualizing_Gradient_Descent_From_With_BCE_Loss
Using only numpy in Python, a neural network with a forward and backward method is used to classify given points (x, y) to a color of red or blue.

- numpy
- scipy
- sklearn
- matplotlib

Given the libraries above, the code should work correctly. I tested the code on Python 3.8 if any version issues occur.
